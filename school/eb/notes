From what I remember, the problem is when V is on another boundary. There has to be a way the author saw around this. So I have some questions:
  How does my boundary look?
  Am i traversing the boundary correctly on Gs and Fs?

So here's how I'm going to solve it:
  Transport loopcut double-holed model
  run o on it
  follow along and understand how o is currently traversing 
    a) triangles
    b) boundaries
  ensure that both (a) and (b) are correct
