opus is smaller and faster than opus, which is smaller than mp3
however, opus is patented. Vorbis might be the way to go then.

Vorbis uses MCDT: modified cosine discrete transform.
MCDT xforms sound from time to frequency domain.
Break freq domain into noise floor and residue components.
Quantize and entropy code it using a codebook and vector quantization algorithm.
