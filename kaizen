/* TODO
 * Kaizen: 
 *   I keep wondering what to do with these system functions. In my system template, 
 *
 *   At least populate functions with argument error-checking.
 * 
 *   I should describe what each function does, provide a small example, and even give a comment-
 *     able, finished line for an unused function if necessary.
 *  
 *   Finally, I should outline a general workflow for component- vs. subcomponent-based systems.
 *
 *   Standardize your sprint flow and figure out what works best. Measure it for science.
 *     For now, this is what I'm thinking:
 *     Day 1: Goals and Design. They intermingle enough to coincide.
 *            Make design concrete enough for rapid development.
 *     Day 2: Dev, build, and test in a tight loop, one function at a time.

// Kaizen explain why existing framework doesn't work before foregoing it
// TODO Kaizen: Give subcomponents bitshifting enum macro.
//              Then put an example of it in the template header file.
