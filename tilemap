I want tilemaps to have the following capabilities:

  animated elements
  loop in any direction
  hardstop when camera collides with boundary
  parallax (scaling of camera position)
  position elements onscreen dependent or independent of camera (text, menus, parallax BGs, etc)
  move srcRect in-place, like dialogue or long menus
  receive atlasTexture so it can convert each index from the subcomponent into an appropriate source rectangle
  copy from atlas texture to component's own texture to save time copying on slight shifts 

RENDERER:
  render components need to tell you which texture they're drawing from now
