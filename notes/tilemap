I want tilemaps to have the following capabilities:
  layers by numbers: >=0 background (scaled by a fixed point number, 0 <= n <= 1 (0 is stagnant, 1 is moves at same speed as layer 0). (8 bits)
  self-moving or moves with camera (1 bit)
  each tilemap has its own top-left cursor and size-- totally like a camera, which is why i went that road before, but i'm worried that'll rob the "true" camera of certain rights it enjoys, like primary collision detection, and its motion alerting various systems to do something.


RENDERER:
  render components need to tell you which texture they're drawing from now <-- hang on, i haven't agreed to this yet
