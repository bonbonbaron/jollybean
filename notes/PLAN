  list hdr
  z-height
  dst rect  <-- for image overlap
  coll rect <-- for collision-triggered logic
  coll type <-- for collision-triggered logic
controller
timer  <-- any way to make this NOT entity-based? would be ideal for animation to hand off its timing logic to this
  think through how you'll pause timers not entity-based... you'll need a *hive* of sorts if possible
  timers should be time remaining rather than "signal at 7:00" so that we can query the milliseconds elapsed and subtract that from all the timers
  it'd be great if timers could start on the same cycle too
  so we should create a way for immediate processing so we can get the timer ID immediately; that way, pausing an entity's behaviors
    can give a way for a non-entity-based timer ID to be paused as well
sound
animated tilemap (2d)   <-- putting this off till last for more immediate reward from the other systems
  grid with the following:
    timer
    collision type
    tile index

  every piece of game data needs gene data attached to it.

add option to body compressor to force any given type of compression. Developer may want speed over size, or vice versa.
take advantage of anim strips' flags to decide whether to anchor dest rect to a corner, side, or center.
