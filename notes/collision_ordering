Z-height zones complicate what otherwise would've been a simple "put moving rectangles in the front". At least it doesn't have to worry about intra-z-height ordering like xRender does. Is it necessary to bite the bullet and implement a sort of fray switching like i do for active/inactive zones? If I do singly linked lists, how would i swiftly put a moving entity in front? If I have to unlink
