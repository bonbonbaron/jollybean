listMerge() should update all new members' list IDs so listRemove() works on them
each blob should now have the pair of collisions, maybe without the blob ID in them (A?)
xRender::zOrder() should iterate over this blob list's new type differently:
  i sense the pairs should enhance sorting since it's list-based. 
  Each pair item may use a boolean to tell if it's been sorted into the outgoing YIP array.
    A B
    B C
    B E
    D E
    E F
