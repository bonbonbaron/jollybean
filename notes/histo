I really hate histos.
I'd like to know how many things i need to make before i make them.
Counting should be done at resource-processing time.
Fortunately, the only system I have that does this now is Actino.
How can I make life easier and faster there?
  * hivemind needs to know how many triggers there are
  * HM also needs to know how many members of each trigger there are
  * damn, that seems ungeneralizable. But I can just say screw that and
    go ahead and make a counter at generation time anyway.
  * HOw does action receive that? It's not going to be stored in a gene,
    and the gene histo is already mainly purposed for gene types for system
    init.
  * Okay, so if I want to not histo or anything, then the only other recourse
    I cna think of is vector-like behavior. Best way to acheive this is to
      1) make an array "too large"
      2) resize it once it's copmlete
      3) rewind the memory block
    But that has to be done before I allocate anything else. That means
      1) i still need to know how many distinct triggers there are.
      2) Every element of the ... CRAP! I still have to allocate one.
         I surrender. I'll histo in Action.

         OR....

         ... honsetly this battle isn't very important to win righ tnow
