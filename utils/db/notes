There is a handful of things I need to keep in mind for my renderer updates:
============================================================================
1) Texture atlas 
  \2) restrict individiual color palette sizes to 4bpp
3) update shared source rectangles' coordinates
  \4) research texture atlas's size limitations
  \5) vectorize colormap inflation and increment indices as needed. FIRST IS ALWAYS ZERO!
6) make 3 copies atlas palette: original, transitional, target
7) detect whether a colorpalette's already in play with new palette member
  \8) parse key from entity and format it
  \9) study your design of key expectations
  \10) study sprite atlases, their rationale, and what they entail
11) generate and manage enums from keys in image files
12) store images and animation structures somewhere
13) test img compression integrity without SDL using memcmp()
14) test img inflation integrity at all 3 bitdepths
