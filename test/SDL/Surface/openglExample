   To compile on linux use
   g++ sdl2_opengl.cpp -o myprogram -l SDL2 -lGL
   ./myprogram

   Damn I didn't see the very top... ))

   Sorry, something went wrong.

   fullscreen vars

   Hello, does anyone know how to build with -lGL? It's not found, i use -lopengl32 instead. Where
   does -lGL come from?

   "-lGL" is for linking with OpenGL under Linux, while "-lopengl32" is used under Windows

   if you get a 2019 error you do not have to change it from cmd to window application.
   i got it to run after having to look it up on StackOverflow. just add this without the quots after
   the included "#undef main"

   Sorry, something went wrong.

   You don't need "#include <GL/gl.h>" because it is already included by "#include
   <SDL2/SDL_opengl.h>" and it also takes care of the problem with OSX.

   Sorry, something went wrong.
